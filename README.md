### The classes in the System.Reflection namespace, together with System.Type, enable you to obtain information about loaded assemblies and the types defined within them, such as classes, interfaces, and value types (that is, structures and enumerations). You can also use reflection to create type instances at run time, and to invoke and access them. For topics about specific aspects of reflection, see Related Topics at the end of this overview.

### These tasks will help you understand reflection and apply the knowledge to your projects.
:one: *Print all values from a.* <br>
:two: *Copy all values from a to b. Compare all b values to a. Divide all b values by property number (b64 = value/64).* <br>
:three: *Copy all values from a to c, except if property has CopyFromB attribute.* <br>
:four: *Copy all values from c to d.* <br>
:five: *Copy all values from c to e. Arrays!!! Split value do it fits* <br>
:six: *Copy all values from d to f. (convert values back). Some property values must be set from different property in same object, based on source attribute. Print differences between f and a.* <br>
:seven: *Copy all values from f to g. Some properties are skipped, put there values in array properties.* <br>
